# Continuum model (tDBG)
---
1. TDBG.py is a variation of [pytwist](https://github.com/sturk111/pytwist) that contains the GN and MN couplings. For further documentation we refer 
to the original repository, that goes beyond tDBG by including other moiré heterostructures.

# Information about the datasets $D_{\text{exp}}$ and theoretical datasets $D_{\text{th}}$
---

1. The experimental dataset $D_{\text{exp}}$ can be found in the folder `expdata`. To see how you can access and preprocess it, take a look 
at `npzread.py`,
2. A few theoretical datasets can be found in Zenodo link such that all plots from the paper can be reproduced.

The traindatasets are bigger, and we only present the one for Sec. 4. Alternative theoretical datasets can be  easily generate via the script `gendata/mpsingle.py`,

3. Auxiliary scripts can be found in the fold `utils`. These consist of options to concatenate datasets generated by `mpsingle.py`, map the 
current labels to different ones (such as $\beta =\{\varphi\} \rightarrow \beta^{\prime} \sin_\varphi, \cos_\varphi$).
